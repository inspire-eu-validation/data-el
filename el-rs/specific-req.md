# Elevation - Requirements on reference systems

**Purpose**: Verify that the following specic requirements on reference systems are meet.

* Sea waters:

	* For measuring the depth of the sea floor where there is an appreciable tidal range (tidal waters), the Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT) shall be used as reference surface.
	* For measuring the depth of the sea floor in marine areas without an appreciable tidal range, in open oceans and in waters that are deeper than 200 meters, the depth of the sea floor shall be referenced to the Mean Sea Level (MSL), or to a well-defined reference level close to the MSL.

* Inland waters:

	* The height of the reference level to which the depth of the floor of an inland water body is measured shall be referred to a gravity-related vertical reference system. This shall be the European Vertical Reference System (EVRS) for the areas within the geographical scope of EVRS, or the gravity-related vertical reference system identified by the Member State outside the scope of EVRS.
	
* Integrated land-sea models:

	* When providing an integrated land-sea elevation model, only one elevation property (either height or depth) shall be modelled, and its values shall be referenced to a single vertical coordinate reference system.


**Prerequisites**

**Test method**

Check manually that the specic requirements on reference systems are meet.
