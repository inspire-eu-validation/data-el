# Elevation - Data provision requirements

**Purpose**: Verify that the dataset is provided with the right application schema, according to the following requirements:

* Provision of Land Elevation Data: Spatial data sets describing the morphology of land elevation shall be made available at least using the spatial object types included in the package Elevation – Grid Coverage.

* Provision of Bathymetry Data: Spatial data sets describing the morphology of bathymetry shall be made available at least using the spatial object types included in either the package Elevation – Grid Coverage or the package Elevation – Vector Elements.


**Prerequisites**

**Test method**

Check manually that:
* if your dataset describes the morphology of land elevation, it is provided at least using the spatial object types included in the package Elevation – Grid Coverage.
* if your dataset describes the morphology of bathymetry, it is provided at least using the spatial object types included in either the package Elevation – Grid Coverage or the package Elevation – Vector Elements.
